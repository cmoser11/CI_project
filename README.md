# **Analyzing Confucius Institute Influence on University Syllabi**  

## **Overview**  
This project examines the impact of **Confucius Institutes (CIs)** on university syllabi by analyzing large-scale academic course data. The study involves:  
- **Extensive data preprocessing** of millions of university syllabi  
- **Natural language processing (NLP)** to identify shifts in curriculum content  
- **Survival regression modeling** to assess changes over time  

The findings aim to quantify how CI partnerships influence academic institutions and course structures.  

## **Methodology**  
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning:**  
   - Processed and structured large-scale syllabus data from multiple universities  
   - Removed inconsistencies, duplicates, and irrelevant course material  
2. **Text Analysis using NLP:**  
   - Applied **tokenization, lemmatization, and topic modeling**  
   - Identified key terminology and curriculum shifts pre- and post-CI presence  
3. **Survival Analysis & Regression Modeling:**  
   - Utilized **Cox Proportional Hazards models** to evaluate syllabus changes over time  
   - Measured differences in course offerings and thematic focus before and after CI partnerships  

## **Technologies & Tools**  
- **Programming Languages:** Python  
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** NLTK, SpaCy, Scikit-learn  
- **Statistical Analysis & Machine Learning:** Statsmodels, Lifelines  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  


## **Key Findings & Insights**  
- Found **variation in the degree of influence** depending on institutional characteristics
