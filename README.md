# **Analyzing Confucius Institute Influence on University Syllabi**  

## **Overview**  
This project examines the impact of **Confucius Institutes (CIs)** on university syllabi by analyzing large-scale academic course data. The study involves:  
- **Extensive data preprocessing** of millions of university syllabi  
- **Natural language processing (NLP)** to identify shifts in curriculum content  
- **Survival regression modeling** to assess changes over time  

The findings aim to quantify how CI partnerships influence academic institutions and course structures.  

## **Methodology**  
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning:**  
   - Processed and structured large-scale syllabus data from multiple universities  
   - Removed inconsistencies, duplicates, and irrelevant course material  
2. **Text Analysis using NLP:**  
   - Applied **tokenization, lemmatization, and topic modeling**  
   - Identified key terminology and curriculum shifts pre- and post-CI presence  
3. **Survival Analysis & Regression Modeling:**  
   - Utilized **Cox Proportional Hazards models** to evaluate syllabus changes over time  
   - Measured differences in course offerings and thematic focus before and after CI partnerships  

## **Technologies & Tools**  
- **Programming Languages:** Python  
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** NLTK, SpaCy, Scikit-learn  
- **Statistical Analysis & Machine Learning:** Statsmodels, Lifelines  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## **Implementation Guide**  
### **1. Setup & Installation**  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cmoser11/CI_project.git  
cd CI_project  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

### **2. Running the Analysis**  
Launch Jupyter Notebook to explore the data and models:  
```bash
jupyter notebook  
```  
Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and execute the analysis notebooks.

## **Key Findings & Insights**  
- Found **variation in the degree of influence** depending on institutional characteristics  

## **Potential Extensions**  
- Expand dataset coverage to additional universities  
- Enhance NLP models with deep learning for improved topic classification  
- Automate insight generation for policy recommendations
